An RBF network is a type of artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. It typically has three layers:
- **Input Layer**
- **Hidden Layer** with RBF activation (e.g., Gaussian)
- **Output Layer**

The hidden layer transforms the input features into a new space using radial basis functions, making it effective for capturing non-linear relationships.
