## Radial Basis Function

An RBF network is a feedforward neural network that uses radial basis functions (like Gaussian) as activation functions in the hidden layer. Itâ€™s particularly well-suited for function approximation and regression.

It typically has three layers:
- **Input Layer**
- **RBF Hidden Layer**: Applies a Gaussian transformation to inputs
- **Output Layer**: Performs linear regression on transformed features

The hidden layer transforms the input features into a new space using radial basis functions, making it effective for capturing non-linear relationships.


## ðŸ›Œ Dataset: Sleep Time Prediction

The model uses the dataset `sleeptime_prediction_dataset.csv`, which contains data that influence sleep duration.


### Features may include:
- Screen time
- Caffeine consumption
- Physical activity
- Stress or anxiety levels
- Work hours, etc.

### Target:
- `Sleep Duration (in hours)`


## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plotting)
- Custom or Scikit-learn-based RBF implementation
